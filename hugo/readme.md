# @now/hugo Example

This directory is a brief example of a static [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) function using the [@now/static-build Builder](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/).

The example is based on the [Hugo Quick Start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and features the basic project scaffolding generated by using the `hugo new site <sitename>` command.
